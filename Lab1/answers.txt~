Exercies

1) all multiples of 3 will cause the program to halt 

2) 2^51 = 2.25 X 10^15

3) a. f(1000) = 14
   b. f(2^k) = k
   c. f((2^k)-1) = 2k - 2

4) Recursively calling the F(n) function for any value n>2 will result in a least one redudant call to F(n). As n moves toward infinity,
the number of redundant calls grows with each call. When F(10) is called, F(1) will subsequently be called 55 times.
